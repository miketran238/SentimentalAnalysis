# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 
The project uses Pytorch as the framework, RNN as the model, SageMaker and AWS as the deployment services.
